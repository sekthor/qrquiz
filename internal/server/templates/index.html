<h1>QR Quiz</h1>
<p>
    This is a proof of concept for a silly app idea.
    The idea is to create a quiz (questions with right and wrong answers), that if solved properly results in a solution.
    The solution is emedded in a QR code, and the users answers modify the QR code.
    If all answers are correct, the QR code will reveal the solution.
